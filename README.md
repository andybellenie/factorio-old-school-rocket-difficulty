# factorio-old-school-rocket-difficulty
A mod for Factorio that restores 1.x rocket difficulty to 2.0 base game.

Directly adds the missing circuits used for creating Rocket Control Units to the rocket but bypasses speed module creation. 

Also adds a little steel to compensate for the simpler production chain.
