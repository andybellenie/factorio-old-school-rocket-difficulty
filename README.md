# Old School Rocket Difficulty

2.0 drastically reduced the resource requirements to launch a rocket in the base game, even without Space Age enabled. 

This removed a lot of the challenge of the end-game.

This mod restores the essence of that challenge without any complex changes by directly adding the removed ingredients
to the recipe for rocket parts, specifically:

- 50 advanced circuits
- 50 electronic circuits

These used to come from the speed module 1 required to build the now deprecated Rocket Control Unit and were a major resource sink.

With this mod, resource requirements to build a rocket are now identical to the game prior to 2.0.
