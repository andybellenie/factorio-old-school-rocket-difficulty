# Old School Rocket Difficulty

Factorio 2.0 drastically reduced the resource requirements to launch a rocket in the base game, removing much of the end-game challenge.

This mod restores that challenge by adding the removed ingredients directly to the rocket part recipe:

- 50 advanced circuits
- 50 electronic circuits

These circuits used to come from the Speed Module 1 required to build the now-deprecated Rocket Control Unit, and were a major resource sink.

## Settings

- **Vanilla** - No changes
- **Pre-2.0** (default) - Restores original rocket part requirements
- **Pre-2.0 Marathon** - 4x multiplier on all ingredients for an extra challenge

## Compatibility

Compatible with Space Age, but automatically disabled when Space Age is active (since rockets work differently in that expansion).
